    "The GET method is used to request data from a web server. When a client sends a GET request, it appends the data to be sent in the URL's query string. This makes the data visible in the URL, and it can be bookmarked, cached, and shared easily. It is commonly used for retrieving data from the server, such as fetching web pages, images, or other resources.\n",

    "The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a web server. When a client sends a POST request, the data is sent in the request body, rather than being appended to the URL like in a GET request. This makes POST requests more secure than GET requests for sensitive data, as the data is not visible in the URL."

This includes data from HTML form submissions, URL parameters, JSON data, cookies, and more. For example, you can use request.form to access form data submitted via POST requests or request.args to access URL parameters in GET requests.\n",
